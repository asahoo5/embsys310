Multiple List Argument (ex: 5 passing arguments):
-------------------------------------------------
a) The calling function passses the arguments through the first four arguments to the called function in registers (R0, R1, R2 and R3). And it stores the 5th argument in the stack, which is read back to one of register in called function.
b) Extra code generated by the calling function:
	- STR instruction to store 5th argument in Stack (since ARM arch supports only 4 registers as Argument/Result Reg.)
c) Extra code generated inside the called function:
	- LDR instruction to load the 5th argument from stack to one of the variable Register.
d) Other Observations:
	- called function uses LR/R13 for storing one of the local variable with Compiler : No-Optimization rule. ([BX LR] instruction was not used for branching back to calling function)
  	- With No compiler optimization option, the called function returns to the calling function by reading back the LR value of it (stored to stack on called function execution) to the PC register with POP instruction. (BX instruction was not used).

	- With compiler optimization ON option, called function utilizes the passed argument register values (i.e. R0, R1, R2, R3) directly instead of storing them in local variable registers. (performs the load operation for 5th argument)
