Why use twoâ€™s complement to represent negative numbers?

Reason for doing this: [courtesy to Wikipedia/2'Complement]
-----------------------------------------------------------
Binary Addition and Subtsraction are made simple by using 2'complement(invertion and addition with one) for negative numbers.

i.e. by doing this, the digital circuitary for addition and substraction can be unified rather treating them separately. In other words, With 2's complement, only one set of instructions is now needed to perform both signed and unsigned arithmetic. Additions and Substractions are now considered same way with an additional step for negative number - where  we identify/process negative negative number through 2'complement logic and then add with positive number.
